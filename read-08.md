- JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

1. Assignment operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Arithmetic operators
4. Bitwise operators
5. Logical operators
6. String operators
7. Conditional (ternary) operator
8. Comma operator
9. Unary operators
10. Relational operators

# JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator: #

- A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values

- An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

## Unary operators ##
 
# A unary operation is an operation with only one operand #

- The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operator

- The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition

- The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. You can override operator precedence by using parentheses.

- An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

## Loops ##

- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

- You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

- Labeled Statement-A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

**Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.**
