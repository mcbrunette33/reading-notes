- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

- The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

 - HTML (<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure> <figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>)

 - CSS (.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
})

- The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
