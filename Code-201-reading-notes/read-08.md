**CSS**

- There are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for multiple elements, flexbox and grid. 

- The display property does two things. The first thing it does is determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block.

- Items will stay on the same axis and not wrap when they run out of space. Instead they will try to squash onto the same line as each other. This behaviour can be changed using the align-items, justify-content and flex-wrap properties.

- Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space).

- Using inline-block gives you a box that has some of the characteristics of a block-level element, but still flows inline with the text.

- The float property instructs an element to "float" to the direction specified. The image in this example is instructed to float left, which then allows sibling elements to "wrap" around it.

- With CSS multicolumn, you can split this into multiple columns to help with both of these issues

- The position property changes how an element behaves in the normal flow of the document, and how it relates to other elements.

**Layout**

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
