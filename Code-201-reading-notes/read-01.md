** Structure

1. HTML pages are text documents.

2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

3. Tags are often referred to as elements.

4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

**Extra Markup -

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©

## HTML 5 Layout -

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

** Process & Design 

- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style. 

- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present
