### Andriod Fundamentals

- Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.

- An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix, contains the contents of an Android app that are required at runtime and it is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

- The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.

- By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.

- Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.

- There are four different types of app components:

 1. Activities

 2. Services

 3. Broadcast receivers

 4. Content providers

- Activities, services, and content providers that you include in your source but do not declare in the manifest are not visible to the system and, consequently, can never run.

- There are a variety of devices powered by Android and not all of them provide the same features and capabilities. To prevent your app from being installed on devices that lack features needed by your app, it's important that you clearly define a profile for the types of devices your app supports by declaring device and software requirements in your manifest file.

- An Android app is composed of more than just codeâ€”it requires resources that are separate from the source code, such as images, audio files, and anything relating to the visual presentation of the app. For example, you can define animations, menus, styles, colors, and the layout of activity user interfaces with XML files. Using app resources makes it easy to update various characteristics of your app without modifying code. Providing sets of alternative resources enables you to optimize your app for a variety of device configurations, such as different languages and screen sizes.
