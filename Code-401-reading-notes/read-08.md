- "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,[1] replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundanc

- When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements

- Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync\

-Duplication is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain. When the rule encoded in a replicated piece of code changes, whoever maintains the code will have to change it in all places correctly.

-"You aren't gonna need it"(YAGNI) is a principle which arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them." Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it" (YAGTNI)and "You ain't gonna need it" (YAGNI).

- A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.

- A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements.
