## List and Keys

- map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values.

- const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2); console.log(doubled);

## Rendering Multiple Components

- you can build a collection of elements and include them in JSX using {}. -loops through the numbers array using map() function and return a element for each item, assign results to listItems.

- const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; const listItems = number.map((number) =>

## Keys

- keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or removed.

- keys should be given to the elements insdie the array to give the elements a stable identity.

- best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings- most often you would use IDs from your data as keys.

- {number} when you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort.
using indexes for keys can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with components state.

- React will default to using indexes as keys if not assigned.

## Extracting Component with Keys

- keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array

## What is React?

- React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JS library for building user interfaces.

- It let you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

- It uses components to tell React what we want to see on the screen.

- A component takes in parameters, call props, and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

- The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result.

- Devs use a special syntax called JSX, whihc makes these structures easier to write.

## Function Components

- function components are a simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and don't have thier own state.
