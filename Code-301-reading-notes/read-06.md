## What is Node.js

- Node.js is a JS runtime built on Chrome's v8 JS engine.
- The V8 engine is the open-source JS egnine that runs in Google Chrome an dother Chromum-based web browsers.
- It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JS directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
- Node.jsis a program we can use to execute JS on our computers/it's a JS runtime.

## Node Binaries vs Version Manager

- Use a version manager when installing
- VM allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them all.
- VM negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and let you set a Node version on a per-project basis.
- run node -v to see if Node is installed on your system

## Node.js and support for Modern JS

- Node has excellent support for ECMAScript (ES6 and beyond). 
- You can write your JS using the latest and most modern syntax and not worry about compatibility issues.

## npm and the JS Package Manager

- Node comes with a package manager call npm
- npm is athe world's largest software registry.
- Install a package Globally - npm install -g jshint
- Install a package Locally - npm init -y 

## What is Node.js Used for?

- Node and npm are used for anything from bundling your JS files and dependencies into static assets, to running test, or automatic code linting and style checking.
- Developing apps in any modern JS framework(React, Angular), you need to know Node and npm.
- These frameworks are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

## Advantage of Node.js

- Speed and scalability.
- Node speak JSON and JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web.
- JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JS program, when you're workign with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting.
- You can have one syntax from browswer to server to database.
- Transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other servier-side languages.
- Can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC.
- Can be used to write your own command line tool.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- Driver and the Navigator.
- Driver types, manages the text editor, switching files, version control and writing code.
- Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
- Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, hwo an algorithm might be converted into code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
- Greater efficeincy, Engaged collaboration, Learning from fellow students, Social Skills, Job interview and work environment readiness.
