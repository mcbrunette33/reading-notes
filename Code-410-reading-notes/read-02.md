### Loops

- The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.

- The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true. 

- A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.
