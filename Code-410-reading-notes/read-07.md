- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

**Javascript Functions**

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

- Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

**Local Variables**

- Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

- Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

**Javascript Operators**

- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

- The addition operator (+) adds numbers:

- Bitwise Operators-Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.

- Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
