Best Practices-Markdown applications donâ€™t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

*Paragraphs-To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.*

**Line Breaks**- To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return
Bold-To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters

**Italicize**- To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

*Block Quotes*- To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

- You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.
- To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
