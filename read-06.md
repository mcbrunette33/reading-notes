**JavaScript** (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

*First Steps- Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.*

**Building Blocks**- Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.

Tools for Writing and debugging Javascript Code:

- Firefox Developer Tools
- JavaScript Shells
- Learn Javascript
- TogetherJS
- Stack Overflow
- JSFiddle
- Plunker

*Creating a TODO list can be considered just a little bit further from "Hello World", the "standard" example people use when learning a new language. In this example we'll build a very basic TODO application using some HTML5 features and JavaScript.*

-At first we have an input element where we'll be able to enter text and it has a button that we'll be able to click.

In the second row we have an empty div element. We are going to display the current list in that element.

Finally we load an external JavaScript file called todo.js
You might want to treat visitors to your site differently based on where they came from. Especially if they came from another page on the same site. You can easily achieve this using some JavaScript code and looking at the referrer.

**4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:**
1. Using var
2. Using let
3. Using const
4. Using nothing

*Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values)*

**NOTES:** 
- JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
- The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
- It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
- You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
- If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
